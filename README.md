## Introduction.
In itself, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science dedicated to building machines and software that replicate or simulate human-like intelligence. AI is generally recognized as a system's ability to perceive its environment, reason through problems, and take actions to achieve a specific goal without being explicitly programmed for every single step.Below we shall cover three of it's concepts:

## Computer Vision
 **Computer Vision** is a field that enables AI to see, interprate and understand images and videos. 
 ### Why Students Should Learn It 
 - Visual of computers has enabled great development in various indusries by:
1. Enhancing development of self driven cars
2. Ensuring security measures are well preserved by the development of face unlock.
3. Used in medican diagnosis and surgeries. ### How to Get Started 1. Install Python and libraries.
2. Install Core Vision Tools 
3. Learn basic Image Operations.
4. Build a starter computer image vision.
5. It has enhanced job employment such as AI Engineering
### Important Topics in Computer Vision
1.	Image Classification
2.	Object Detection
3.	Image Segmentation
4.	Feature Extraction
