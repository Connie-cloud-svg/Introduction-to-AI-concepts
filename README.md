## Introduction.
In itself, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science dedicated to building machines and software that replicate or simulate human-like intelligence. AI is generally recognized as a system's ability to perceive its environment, reason through problems, and take actions to achieve a specific goal without being explicitly programmed for every single step.We shall cover three of it's concepts which are listed and explained below:

## Machine Learning 
**Machine learning** is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve at tasks without being explicitly programmed for every rule.

### Core Concepts and Components.
- **Algorithms vs. Models:** An algorithm is the set of rules used to solve a problem, while a model is the trained output used to make predictions.
- **Data Training:** Systems analyze vast amounts of data (e.g., thousands of labeled images) to recognize patterns.
- **Foundations:** Machine learning relies heavily on mathematics, statistics, and programming.

### Key Types of Machine Learning.
They include:
1. **Supervised Learning:** Models are trained on labeled data to map inputs to known outputs *(e.g., spam detection).*
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** Models identify hidden patterns or structures in unlabeled data *(e.g., clustering similar customers).*
3. **Neural Networks/Deep Learning:** Algorithms simulating the human brain, used for complex tasks like language translation and computer vision.
4. **Regression/Classification:** Regression predicts continuous values (e.g., prices), while classification predicts categories *(e.g., yes/no).*

### Real-World Applications
- **Healthcare:** Analyzing *MRI scans* and *X-rays* for disease diagnosis.
- **Business & Technology:** Personalized recommendations on Netflix, email filtering in Gmail, and fraud detection in finance.
- **Autonomous Systems:** Self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla, Waymo).
